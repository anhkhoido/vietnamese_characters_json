This repository contains a tutorial on how to write Vietnamese characters in a JSON file.

In order to write any given Vietnamese tonic marks properly in a JSON file, one has two options:

1) Manually enter Unicode escape sequence.
2) Use the JavaScript escapes tool developed by Mathias Bynens, which is available at this link: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/mothereff.in/tree/master/js-escapes.
